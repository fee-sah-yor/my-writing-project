# ✨ My Favorite Books (aka My Escapes)

Let’s be honest — I read to escape. If it doesn’t have magic, emotional damage, or characters fighting for kingdoms and curses, I probably haven’t read it. Historical fiction? Yes. Fantasy? Absolutely. Self-help? That’s cute, but I have the Bible.

Here’s a running list of my absolute faves:

## 🧙‍♀️ Fantasy That Lives in My Head Rent-Free

- **Six of Crows** by Leigh Bardugo  
  A morally grey gang of outcasts trying to pull off the greatest heist ever? Sign me up every time.

- **The Priory of the Orange Tree** by Samantha Shannon  
  Dragons, sapphic queens, and an epic slow burn. Long? Yes. Worth it? Completely.

- **An Ember in the Ashes** by Sabaa Tahir  
  This series hurt me. In the best way. Also: enemies-to-lovers supremacy.

- **Throne of Glass** by Sarah J. Maas  
  If you know, you know. (Also yes, I read *ACOTAR* too.)

## 🏰 Historical Fiction That Feeds My Soul

- **The Book Thief** by Markus Zusak  
  Narrated by Death. Set in Nazi Germany. Heartbreaking and beautiful.

- **The Nightingale** by Kristin Hannah  
  Sisters. Resistance. World War II. I cried. You’ll cry.

- **Homegoing** by Yaa Gyasi  
  A multi-generational journey from Ghana to the U.S. Stunning, heavy, unforgettable.

## 📖 The One Book That Grounds It All

- **The Bible**  
  My ultimate source of wisdom, comfort, and truth. Nothing else compares.

This list grows (and rotates) depending on my mood, the weather, and how attached I am to fictional characters that don’t text back. 📚✨
